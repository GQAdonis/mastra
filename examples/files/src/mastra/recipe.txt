Homemade Margherita Pizza Recipe
Ingredients:
For the dough (makes 2 pizzas):

2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast (1 packet)
1 1/2 cups warm water (about 110¬∞F / 45¬∞C)
1 tsp sugar
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (plus extra for dusting)
2 tbsp olive oil (plus extra for greasing)
1 tsp salt
For the tomato sauce:

1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes (or whole tomatoes, blended)
1 tbsp olive oil
1 garlic clove, minced
1 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)
Salt and pepper to taste
For the topping:

8 oz fresh mozzarella, sliced
A handful of fresh basil leaves
Olive oil (for drizzling)
Salt, to taste
Instructions:
Step 1: Prepare the dough
Activate the yeast: In a small bowl, combine the warm water, yeast, and sugar. Stir to dissolve and let it sit for 5-10 minutes until the mixture becomes frothy.

Make the dough: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the activated yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir until the dough begins to come together, then knead on a lightly floured surface for about 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.

Let it rise: Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap. Let it rise in a warm place for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.

Step 2: Prepare the sauce
Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saut√© for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.

Add the crushed tomatoes, oregano, red pepper flakes (if using), salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Set aside.

Step 3: Assemble the pizza
Preheat your oven to 475¬∞F (245¬∞C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it preheats. If not, a baking sheet works just fine!

Punch down the dough and divide it in half. Roll out each half into a round or oval shape on a floured surface, aiming for about 10-12 inches in diameter.

Transfer the dough to a parchment paper-lined pizza peel or baking sheet. If you're using a pizza stone, dust the pizza peel with flour or cornmeal to prevent sticking.

Top the pizza: Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Add slices of fresh mozzarella evenly over the sauce.

Step 4: Bake the pizza
Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned. Keep an eye on it, as ovens vary.

Once out of the oven, immediately top the pizza with fresh basil leaves and drizzle lightly with olive oil.

Slice and serve while hot!

Tips:
Dough variations: If you're short on time, you can use store-bought pizza dough or even a pre-made pizza crust.
Mozzarella: For the best texture and flavor, use fresh mozzarella (not the pre-shredded kind). You can also use burrata for an extra creamy texture.
Make-ahead: You can make the dough a day ahead, and let it rise slowly in the fridge overnight for even better flavor.
Enjoy your homemade Margherita pizza‚Äîcrispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, with that perfect balance of tangy sauce and fresh cheese! üçï
