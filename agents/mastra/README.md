# Mastra Development Agent

A specialized AI agent built using Mastra to assist in developing and maintaining Mastra codebases, powered by Anthropic's Claude.

## Overview

This agent is designed to help with:

- Code understanding and navigation
- Code generation and modification
- Debugging and troubleshooting
- Best practices enforcement
- Documentation assistance

## Setup Requirements

1. Core Dependencies

```json
{
  "@mastra/core": "latest",
  "@ai-sdk/anthropic": "latest",
  "zod": "latest"
}
```

2. Environment Configuration

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## Agent Configuration

### 1. Define Agent Tools

Create specialized tools for:

- Code search and navigation
- File operations (read/write/edit)
- Dependency management
- Testing and validation
- Documentation generation

### 2. Set Up Agent Configuration

```typescript
import { createAnthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';

const model = createAnthropic({
  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
  model: 'claude-3-opus-20240229', // Latest Claude model
  temperature: 0.7,
});

const agent = new Agent({
  name: 'MastraDevAgent',
  instructions: `You are a specialized AI agent for Mastra development, powered by Claude.
Your primary tasks are:
1. Help developers understand and navigate the codebase
2. Assist in writing and modifying code following Mastra best practices
3. Debug issues and propose solutions
4. Generate and maintain documentation
5. Leverage Claude's strong code understanding and generation capabilities`,
  model: model,
  tools: devTools,
  memory: memory, // Optional memory configuration
});
```

### 3. Define Core Workflows

Key workflows to implement:

- Code analysis and understanding
- Code generation and modification
- Testing and validation
- Documentation management
- Dependency management

## Usage Examples

1. Code Understanding

```typescript
await agent.generate('Explain the purpose and structure of the Mastra Agent class');
```

2. Code Generation

```typescript
await agent.generate('Create a new Mastra tool for handling vector store operations');
```

3. Documentation

```typescript
await agent.generate('Generate documentation for the MastraLLM class');
```

## Best Practices

1. Tool Design

   - Keep tools focused and single-purpose
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add clear documentation
   - Leverage Claude's strong code understanding

2. Agent Instructions

   - Be specific about the agent's capabilities
   - Include examples in instructions
   - Define clear boundaries
   - Utilize Claude's context window effectively

3. Memory Management
   - Configure appropriate memory retention
   - Clean up unused memory
   - Use context effectively
   - Take advantage of Claude's long context window

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Implement core development tools
2. [ ] Set up testing framework
3. [ ] Add documentation generation capabilities
4. [ ] Create example workflows
5. [ ] Add telemetry and monitoring
6. [ ] Fine-tune Claude's instructions for Mastra development

## Contributing

When contributing to this agent:

1. Follow Mastra coding standards
2. Add tests for new functionality
3. Update documentation
4. Use conventional commits
5. Document Claude-specific optimizations
