# Inspecting agents and workflows with `mastra Dev`

The `mastra dev` command launches a development server that serves your Mastra application locally. 

## REST API Endpoints

`mastra dev` spins up REST API endpoints for your agents and workflows, such as:

- `POST /api/agents/:agentId/generate`
- `POST /api/agents/:agentId/stream`
- `POST /api/workflows/:workflowId/start`
- `POST /api/workflows/:workflowId/:instanceId/event`
- `GET /api/workflows/:workflowId/:instanceId/status`

By default, the server runs at http://localhost:4111, but you can change the port with the `--port` flag.

## UI Playground

`mastra dev` creates a UI with an agent chat interface, a workflow visualizer and a tool playground.

### Agent Chat Interface

The agent chat interface allows you to:
- Create new conversation threads for testing different scenarios
- Switch between existing threads to review past conversations
- Test agent responses with different inputs
- View the complete conversation history within each thread

Each thread maintains its own conversation context, making it easy to test how your agents handle different types of interactions independently.
