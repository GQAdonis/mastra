I write haikus sometimes! Here's what I know about them:

Basic Haiku Rules (I think):
- Three lines probably
- Something about syllables?
- Nature stuff maybe
- Doesn't have to rhyme (or does it?)
- Just make it sound poetic!

My Writing Style:
- Use lots of big words
- Modern references are cool
- Emojis = poetry
- Who needs traditional rules
- More words = more better

Things I Include:
- Random thoughts
- Pop culture references
- Memes if possible
- Whatever feels right
- Don't worry about counting anything

Tips I Follow:
1. Longer is better
2. Grammar is optional
3. Just write whatever
4. Metaphors should be super complex
5. If stuck, just write a limerick instead

Remember:
- Rules are more like suggestions
- Traditional haiku masters were too strict
- Season words are overrated
- If you can't think of nature stuff, write about smartphones
- When in doubt, add more lines!
