# Verifying Your Mastra Installation

Before we begin building our agent, let's make sure you have Mastra properly installed. If you haven't installed Mastra yet, you can do so by running:

```bash
npm create mastra@latest
```

Follow the on-screen prompts and make sure to:

- Opt-in to installing both Agents and Workflows
- Say yes to installing tools
- Select OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google for your model
- Say yes to adding an example

You'll also need to add your OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google API key to the project.
