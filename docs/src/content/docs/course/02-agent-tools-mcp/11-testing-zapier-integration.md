# Testing the Zapier Integration

Let's test the Zapier integration:

1. Make sure your development server is running with `npm run dev`
2. Open the playground at http://localhost:4111/
3. Try asking your agent to perform tasks that use Zapier, such as:
   - "Check my recent emails"
   - "Draft a tweet about the latest JavaScript features"
   - "Summarize my unread emails"

If everything is set up correctly, your agent should be able to use the Zapier tools to perform these tasks.

Testing your integration is an important step to ensure that your agent can properly access and use the Zapier tools. When you ask your agent to perform a task that requires Zapier, it should recognize the need to use the appropriate Zapier tool and make the necessary API calls to complete the task.
