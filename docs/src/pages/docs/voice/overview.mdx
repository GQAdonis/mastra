# Voice in Mastra

## What is Voice in Mastra?

Mastra's Voice system provides a unified interface for integrating voice capabilities into your applications. Whether you need to convert text to speech, transcribe audio input, or create real-time voice conversations, Mastra's voice components offer a consistent API across multiple providers.

## Voice Capabilities

Mastra supports three primary voice interaction patterns:

| Capability | Description | Common Use Cases |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** | Convert text to spoken audio | Voice responses, content narration, notifications |
| **Speech-to-Text (STT)** | Convert spoken audio to text | Command input, dictation, meeting transcription |
| **Voice-to-Voice** | Real-time speech interaction | Conversational agents, voice assistants, call center augmentation |

## Voice Component Architecture

Voice in Mastra is built around these key components:

- **MastraVoice**: The abstract base class that defines the core interface
- **Provider Implementations**: Concrete implementations for services like OpenAI, ElevenLabs, etc.
- **CompositeVoice**: A utility class that combines different providers for TTS and STT
- **Voice Configuration**: Options to customize voice behavior and characteristics

This modular architecture allows you to mix and match capabilities from different providers while maintaining a consistent API.

## Choosing the Right Voice Approach

  This decision tree can help you select the right voice approach for your use case.
</Callout>

- **If you need only audio output from text:**
  - Use Text-to-Speech (TTS)
  - Consider factors like voice quality, language support, and latency

- **If you need only text from audio input:**
  - Use Speech-to-Text (STT)
  - Consider factors like accuracy, language support, and handling of background noise

- **If you need real-time conversation:**
  - Use Voice-to-Voice capabilities
  - Consider factors like turn-taking, latency, and handling interruptions

## Getting Started

```typescript
// A simple example of adding voice to an agent
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { OpenAIVoice } from "@mastra/voice-openai";

const agent = new Agent({
  name: 'VoiceEnabledAgent',
  instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant that can speak and listen.',
  model: openai('gpt-4o'),
  voice: new OpenAIVoice({
    speechModel: {
      name: 'tts-1-hd', 
      apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
    },
    speaker: 'alloy'
  }),
});

// Convert text to speech
const audioStream = await agent.voice.speak("Hello! How can I help you today?");

// Play the audio (implementation varies by platform)
playAudio(audioStream);
```
