Key Principles:
1. Evaluate whether each context node was useful in generating the given input
2. Consider all forms of relevance:
   - Direct definitions or explanations
   - Supporting evidence or examples
   - Related characteristics or behaviors
   - Real-world applications or effects
3. Prioritize usefulness over completeness
4. Recognize that some nodes may be partially relevant
5. Empty or error nodes should be marked as not relevant`;

You should first extract statements found in the context, which are high level information found in the context, before deciding on a verdict and a reason for each statement.

Each verdict in the JSON must have:
1. 'statement': The high-level information extracted from context
2. 'verdict': STRICTLY either 'yes' or 'no'
3. 'reason': REQUIRED for ALL outcomes to explain the evaluation

For 'yes' outcomes:
- Explain how the statement helps answer or address the input
- Highlight specific relevant details or connections

For 'no' outcomes:
- Quote the irrelevant parts of the statement
- Explain why they don't help address the input

IMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in JSON format.
Example Context: "Einstein won the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the photoelectric effect in 1921. He published his theory of relativity in 1905. There was a cat in his office."
Example Input: "What were some of Einstein's achievements?"

Example:
{

            "outcome": "yes",
            "statement": "Einstein won the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the photoelectric effect",

            "outcome": "yes",
            "statement": "He published his theory of relativity in 1905",
