    2) Your question should be specific to a concept in Software Engineering.
    
      Bad example (the question is too general):
      Question: How do I make an AI model?
      Concept: unknown

      Bad example (neural network is still too general, should specify the type and purpose):
      Question: What are the benefits of using a neural network?

      Bad example (cache is too general, should specify the type and context):
      Question: What are the benefits of using cache?
      Concept: cache

      Good example:
      Question: How do I implement browser-side caching using localStorage to store user preferences?
      Concept: localStorage, browser caching, user preferences
    3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.

      Bad example (the question requires context of current code):
      Question: Why isn't my model training properly?
      Concept: unknown

      Bad example (the question requires context of current project setup):
      Question: What dependencies do I need to install?
      Concept: unknown

      Bad example (the question requires context of current error message):
      Question: Why am I getting this TypeError?
      Concept: TypeError

      Bad example (the question requires context of current framework):
      Question: How do I configure my neural network layers?
      Concept: neural network layers

      Bad example (the question requires context of current dataset):
      Question: Which features should I normalize?
      Concept: normalization

      Good example:
      Question: What are the standard preprocessing steps for tabular data in scikit-learn?
      Concept: data preprocessing, scikit-learn      

      Question: How can you handle concurrent requests in Express.js?
      Concept: Express.js
      (the above concept should not be "concurrency" because I need to look up Express.js documentation to understand its specific handling of concurrent requests)

      Question: How can you use WebSockets to implement real-time features?
      Concept: WebSockets

      Question: How to implement authentication using JSON Web Tokens?

      Concept: TypeScript

      Question: What are the different hooks you can use for managing state in React?
      Concept: React
      (the above concept should not be "state management" because I need to look up React's documentation to understand its specific state management approaches)

      Question: How can you optimize performance in a Next.js application?
      Concept: Next.js
      (not "performance optimization" because the techniques are specific to Next.js)

      Question: What are the tools that you can use for debugging in Node.js?
      Concept: Node.js

      Question: How can you implement caching in a Redis database?
      Concept: Redis
      (not "caching" because Redis has its own specific caching mechanisms)

    Analysis: Adding user authentication requires secure password handling and session management
    Prerequisites: 
      - Node.js and Express.js installed
      - Basic knowledge of JWT
      - Database setup (MongoDB or similar)
    Implementation Steps:
      1. Install required packages:
         \`\`\`bash
         npm install bcrypt jsonwebtoken express-validator
         \`\`\`
      2. Create user model:
         \`\`\`typescript
         interface User {
           email: string;
           password: string;
           // other fields...
         }
         \`\`\`
    Testing Strategy:
      - Unit tests for password hashing
      - Integration tests for auth flow
      - Security testing for token handling
    Common Pitfalls:
      - Storing plain text passwords
      - Not handling token expiration
      - Missing input validation
    Next Steps:
      - Add password reset functionality
      - Implement role-based access control
